# **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**

## Overview

The **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** is a proactive security solution designed to monitor, analyze, and protect network traffic within a system, helping detect unauthorized access attempts and potential security breaches. Using sophisticated detection techniques, including signature-based and anomaly-based methods, NIDS continuously scans data packets and alerts administrators of suspicious patterns. This enables organizations to respond quickly, mitigate risks, and secure network integrity.
