**Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**

### Definition
This software is primarily designed to monitor and analyze network traffic within a device todetect unauthorized access or anomalies
indicative of potential security breaches. It continuously examines data packets moving across the network, employing various detection
techniques, including signature-based and anomaly-based methods. By identifying suspicious patterns or behaviors, the system alerts 
administrators to potential threats, enabling prompt responses to mitigate risks. Key features often include real-time monitoring,
logging of detected intrusions, alerts for abnormal activities, and comprehensive reporting capabilities to enhance overall network 
security.

### Project Scope for Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
#### 1. **Project Objectives**
   - Develop a robust NIDS to monitor, detect, and alert on potential security threats within a network.
   - Ensure the system can analyze traffic in real-time and maintain high levels of accuracy in threat detection.

#### 2. **Key Features**
   - **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring:** Capture and analyze network traffic to detect intrusions as they occur.
   - **Detection Methods:**
     - **Signature-Based Detection:** Identify known threats by matching traffic against a database of known attack signatures.
     - **Anomaly-Based Detection:** Establish a baseline of normal network behavior and flag deviations from this baseline.
   - **Alerting Mechanism:** Generate alerts for detected intrusions, anomalies, or suspicious activities, providing detailed logs for further analysis.
   - **Logging and Reporting:** Maintain comprehensive logs of network traffic and incidents, with the ability to generate reports for security assessments.
   - **User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface for monitoring alerts, configuring settings, and reviewing traffic data.

#### 3. **Functional Requirements**
   - Ability to support multiple network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, UDP).
   - Integration with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
   - Customizable alert thresholds and notification settings.
   - Capability to identify various types of attacks, such as DDoS, port scanning, and malware infiltration.

#### 4. **Technical Requirements**
   - **Architecture:** Design a scalable and modular architecture to support various network environments.
   - **Technology Stack:** Select appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and tools for development (e.g., Python, Snort, Suricata).
   - **Data Storage:** Implement secure storage solutions for logs and reports, considering data retention policies.
   - **Performance Metrics:** Establish performance benchmarks for detection accuracy, speed, and resource utilization.

#### 5. **Implementation Phases**
   - **Phase 1:** Requirements gathering and analysis, including stakeholder interviews and threat modeling.
   - **Phase 2:** Design and development of the core detection engine and user interface.
   - **Phase 3:** Testing and validation of detection capabilities in controlled environments.
   - **Phase 4:** Deployment and configuration within the target network environment.
   - **Phase 5:** Ongoing maintenance, updates, and user training.

#### 6. **Limitations**
   - Scope will not include the deployment of active response measures (e.g., firewall adjustments) as part of the initial release.
   - The system will focus on monitoring a predefined set of network devices and may not cover all potential endpoints in the organization.

#### 7. **Assumptions**
   - The target network infrastructure will be compatible with the NIDS architecture.
   - Necessary permissions and access to network devices will be granted for deployment and monitoring.

#### 8. **Deliverables**
   - Functional NIDS software with user documentation.
   - Comprehensive testing and validation reports.
   - Training materials for end-users and administrators.
   - Maintenance and support plan for ongoing operations.
